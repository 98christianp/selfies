Welcome to the SELFIES documentation!
===================================
SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings) is a 100% robust molecular string
representation. A main objective is to use SELFIES as direct input into
machine learning models, in particular in generative models, for the
generation of outputs with high validity.

This library is intended to be light-weight and easy to use.

For explanation of the principle and experiments:
